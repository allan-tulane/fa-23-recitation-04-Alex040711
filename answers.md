    1b.

* Quicksort's average-case time complexity is **O**(n log **n**) and worst-case is **O**(**n^**2**)**. For random permutations and using random pivots, Quicksort tends to perform closer to its average case.
* Selection sort has a time complexity of **O**(n^**2)** for both average and worst-case scenarios.
* Quicksort with a fixed pivot on an already sorted list will have a worst-case scenario, which will be much slower.
* Random pivot Quicksort will not be as heavily affected by the already sorted input.
* Selection sort's performance remains consistent since it always checks all elements regardless of order.
* 
* 1c.
* Timsort performs very well compared to other sorting algorithms for most data patterns, especially for larger data sets.
